# Voice Assistant Development Notes

## Project Overview
- Building a voice assistant using Electron, Deepgram for STT/TTS, and OpenAI for AI processing
- Currently in Phase 2: AI Conversation Mode (recording -> STT -> OpenAI -> TTS -> playback)

## Development Timeline

### Initial Setup
- Created Electron app structure
- Implemented basic UI with Start/Stop recording buttons
- Added visual feedback (recording indicator, processing indicator)
- Set up environment configuration (.env for API keys)

### Audio Implementation Progress
1. First Implementation
   - Used MediaRecorder API
   - Basic audio recording functionality
   - Simple playback mechanism
   - Issues with format compatibility with Deepgram

2. Deepgram Integration Attempt 1
   - Created DeepgramService class
   - Added STT and TTS functionality
   - Encountered issues with audio format
   - WebSocket connection problems

3. Test Implementation & Integration
   - Created successful test implementation
   - Used Web Audio API for proper audio format
   - Implemented real-time transcription
   - Working TTS playback
   - Successfully integrated into main application
   - Cleaned up test files

4. Code Refactoring & Improvements
   - Split monolithic UIController into modular components
   - Created specialized managers for different concerns:
     - AudioManager: Handles audio recording and playback
     - UIStateManager: Manages UI state and elements
     - TranscriptManager: Handles transcript processing
   - Improved transcript handling for pauses in speech
   - Better state management and error handling
   - Enhanced code maintainability and testability

5. OpenAI Integration
   - Added OpenAIService module for AI text processing
   - Implemented conversation flow: Speech → STT → OpenAI → TTS → Speech
   - Updated UI to display conversation history
   - Added configuration options for OpenAI models and parameters
   - Improved error handling for API interactions
   - Fixed browser environment compatibility issues

### Current State
- UI Components: ✓ Working
- Audio Recording: ✓ Working
- STT (Speech-to-Text): ✓ Working with pause handling
- AI Processing: ✓ Working with OpenAI integration
- TTS (Text-to-Speech): ✓ Working with AI-generated responses
- Conversation UI: ✓ Working with user/assistant messages
- Code Organization: ✓ Modular and Clean

## Features
- Real-time audio capture using Web Audio API
- Live transcription via Deepgram WebSocket
- Proper handling of speech pauses
- Complete transcript accumulation
- AI processing of transcribed text via OpenAI
- Text-to-speech conversion of AI responses
- Conversational UI with message history
- Visual feedback for all operations
- Error handling and recovery
- Clean separation of concerns

## Technical Specifications
- Audio Format: 16-bit PCM
- Sample Rate: 16kHz
- Channels: Mono
- WebSocket Parameters: encoding=linear16&sample_rate=16000&channels=1

## Code Organization
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Each module under 300 lines
- Consistent error handling
- Clear documentation and comments
- No code duplication
- Each module has a single responsibility
- Easy to test and maintain
- Centralized configuration

## Working Reference Implementation
The working implementation now features:
- Modular component architecture
- Web Audio API for audio capture
- Real-time PCM audio conversion
- Robust WebSocket connection handling
- Proper audio format (16-bit PCM, 16kHz, mono)
- Complete transcript management
- OpenAI integration for AI responses
- Conversational UI with message history
- Improved state management

## Next Steps
1. Add conversation history persistence
2. Implement context management for multi-turn conversations
3. Add user settings for AI model selection
4. Add unit tests for each module
5. Implement error boundary handling
6. Add configuration options for audio settings
7. Consider adding a debug mode
8. Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
9. Add analytics for performance monitoring
10. Explore offline mode with local models
